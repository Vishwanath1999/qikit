    "## 1.Introduction\n",
    "  What does it mean for a computer to be able to do everything that it could possibly do? This was a question tackled by Alan Turing before we even had a good idea of what a computer was, or how to build one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ask this question for our classical computers, and specifically for our standard digital computers, we need to strip away all the screens, speakers and fancy input devices. What we are left with is simply a machine that converts input bit strings into output bit strings. If a device can perform any such conversion, taking any arbitrary set of inputs and converting them to an arbitrarily chosen set of corresponding outputs, we call it universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers similarly take input states and convert them into output states. We will therefore be able to define universality in a similar way. To be more precise, and to be able to prove when universality can and cannot be achieved, it is useful to use the matrix representation of our quantum gates. But first we'll need to brush up on a few techniques."
